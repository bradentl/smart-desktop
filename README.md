# Smart Desktop

This project is a self-adjusting desktop stand, which adjusts itself automatically to an appropriate height by detecting the user's face.

## Mechanical
The stand uses a scissor lift mechanism to vertically adjust the laptop's position.

## Electronics and Electrical
We use servo motors to operate the scissor lift, and a camera and Raspberry Pi to conduct the facial recognition.

## Software
We use Python for the scissor lift servo code, and Python & OpenCV for the facial recognition system.

### Dependencies
* OpenCV
* Dlib
